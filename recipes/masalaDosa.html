    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soak and ferment the batter:</strong> Soak rice, urad dal, and poha separately in water for 4 to 6 hours. After soaking, grind them together with water to make a smooth batter. Add salt and keep the batter to ferment overnight or for 8 to 12 hours until it rises and becomes airy.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the potato masala:</strong> Boil potatoes, peel them, and mash them. In a pan, heat oil and add mustard seeds. Once they splutter, add urad dal, chopped green chilies, curry leaves, and a pinch of hing. Then add sliced onions and sauté until golden. Add turmeric powder and the mashed potatoes. Mix well, cook for a few minutes, and turn off the flame. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves if desired.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the dosa:</strong> Heat a tawa and pour a ladle of fermented batter in the center. Spread it out evenly in a circular motion to make a thin layer. Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges and cook until it turns golden and crispy.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Add the filling and fold:</strong> Place a portion of the potato masala in the center of the dosa. Fold the dosa over the filling and press gently.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve hot with coconut chutney, tomato chutney, and sambar for a complete South Indian meal.</li>
